# BD! (лћла!)
This app allows to control the birthdays of friends in the social network [VK](https://vk.com) and helps to choose a gift for your friend.

I develop BD! using <b>Kotlin</b> as a programming language with the connection of <b>MVP</b> + <b>RxJava / RxKotlin</b>. 
The list of used libraries:
 * [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
 * [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
 * [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid)
 * [RxKotlin]( https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin)
 * [Realm](https://realm.io/)
 * [Retrofit 2.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
 * [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
 * [Material Calendar View](https://github.com/prolificinteractive/material-calendarview)
 
I hope this project will help someone to learn something new about a Kotlin language.
